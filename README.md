#  Orientation for the ELISA Linux Foundation project

This site develops web-based documentation to introduce newcomers to the project and to provide background information about the project for participants.

The documentation is written in markdown.
Currently, it is being published on the GitHub Cloud Pages website associated with this repo ([link to site](https://www.elisa.tech)).
GitHub uses its own flavour of markdown, gfm, for the readme's and wikis on its sites, but
for Cloud Pages, it supports kramdown extensions.
This site uses those extensions, although ultimately the documentation may be published on another internet domain.

NOTE:

Should you want to contribute to the site, the 
[wiki](https://github.com/elisa-tech/orientation/wiki)
contains information on:
- setting up a local site and development environment
- markdown and kramdown, as used on this site
- tips and tricks related to extensions defined for this site
